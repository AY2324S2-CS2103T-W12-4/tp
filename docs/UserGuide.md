## Introduction
Welcome to *ConnectCare User Guide*, a guide to use the *ConnectCare* application.
*ConnectCare* helps you manage your client contacts faster and more reliably.

## Who ConnectCare Is For

ConnectCare is a powerful application designed to make social workers' lives easier, especially those juggling high caseloads. It prioritizes keyboard shortcuts, eliminating the need to constantly switch between keyboard and mouse. This focus on keyboard navigation translates to:

* Increased Efficiency: Spend less time navigating the software and more time directly helping clients.
* Reduced Errors: Minimize the possibility of errors caused by switching between input methods.
* Boosted Productivity: Complete tasks faster and free up valuable time for client interaction.

### Embrace a Keyboard-Centric Approach

Social workers often spend significant time documenting and updating client information.  By minimizing the need to use a mouse, ConnectCare allows for a smoother workflow, especially when working remotely or on laptops.

This approach can significantly reduce:

* Hand fatigue and strain.
* Cognitive load from switching between input methods.
* Overall time spent completing tasks.

### Work Offline, Stay Productive

One of the key benefits of ConnectCare is that it doesn't require a constant internet connection. This allows you to work seamlessly even in areas with limited or no internet access.  Whether you're conducting a home visit or working remotely in the field, ConnectCare ensures you can access and update client information efficiently.

### Sensitive Data is kept Secure

We understand that social workers handle sensitive client information. Since ConnectCare functions offline, your data never needs to be transmitted over the internet or stored on remote servers. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access compared to cloud-based solutions. ConnectCare prioritizes data security by storing information [locally](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#local) on your device.

### Focus on Your Clients, Not Software

By streamlining workflows and offering social work-specific features, ConnectCare empowers you to focus on what matters most: your clients. You can spend more time building rapport with clients, respond to inquiries and needs more promptly and ultimately focus on delivering high-quality care.

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide does not assume any technical knowledge from users. We just require users to be able to type on a keyboard. As ConnectCare uses a [CLI](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#cli), users who are familiar with a CLI would find it easy to transition to this software. However, if you have not used a CLI application before, there would be a step-by-step introduction in this guide for each command.

## How to Use This Guide

There is no wrong way to read this guide: if you want to skip ahead, go for it! Each section is contained in itself, and you can find what you are looking for without needing to read the previous sections. However, we recommend that you read through the entire guide at least once before utilizing the application, so that you would have a more thorough understanding of the all necessary features.

This guide is comprised of 4 main sections:
1. The [**Quick Start**](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start) section, we will walk through you in how to get started installing as well as running the ConnectCare on your own desktop

2. The [**Features Section**](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#features) will provide a comprehensive, easy-to-understand guide on how to fully make use of all of ConnectCare's functionalities and commands.

3. The [**FAQ**](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#faq) section will answer commonly asked questions, addressing potential further queries you might have!

4. Lastly, the [**Glossary**](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#faq) contains a list of key terms and definitions that might be helpful

## Features

### Notes about the command format:
-   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
    e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

-   Items in square brackets are optional.  
    e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

-   Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.  
    e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

-   Parameters can be in any order.  
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

-   Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.  
    e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Adding a new client: `add`

This command adds a new client to your client list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]… [k/NEXTOFKIN]`

**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags (or even 0!) **Tip:** A person's next of kin field is optional (it can be ommitted if a person does not have a next of kin)

Examples:

-   `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
-   `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`
-   `add n/Bill James p/01232228943 e/billj@example.com a/12 College Avenue West t/high priority k/John Doe`

### Updating a client : `update`

This command helps update existing client's information in the client list in the event that something changes.

Format: `update u/existing user [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…`

Examples:

-   `Update u/Jane Doe n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-011` updates the information of Jane Doe's information to be  
    name: John Doe  
    Phone no: 98765432  
    email: [johnd@example.com](mailto:johnd@example.com)  
    address: John street, block 123, #01-011

### Locating persons by name: `find`

This command allows you to find a specific client in your client list by their **name**

Format: `find n/NAME`

Examples: Lets say your contact list contains the following contacts: **John Doe** **John Lee** **Alex Lee** **Bobby Chan**

-   `find John` would return `John Doe` as well as `John Lee`
-   `find Alex Lee` would return `Alex Lee`
-   `find Lee` would return `John Lee` as well as `Alex Lee`

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

This command allows you to purge your client list, removing **ALL** clients in your client list.

Format: `clear`

**Caution:** Only use this command if you are **absolutely** sure that you are willing to clear **all** of your clients from the list, as after running this command, any existing clients will be **unrecoverable**.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

This command allows you to exit the application.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

Your locally saved client list will be updated after any change is made, so no further action needs to be taken when operating the application! On start-up, your existing client list (if it exists) will also be automatically loaded, so don't worry about that!

NOTE: If it is your first time running the program, and there is no existing client list, a new file will automatically be generated to store your new client list!
