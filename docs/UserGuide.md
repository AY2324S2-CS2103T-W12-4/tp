## Introduction
Welcome to the *ConnectCare User Guide*, your comprehensive resource for managing client contacts with ease!
Designed to help you handle demanding caseloads, *ConnectCare* empowers you to navigate your client interactions seamlessly. Whether you're troubleshooting issues, just getting started, or looking to enhance your workflow, this guide has you covered.

## Who ConnectCare is For

ConnectCare is designed to help social workers with high caseloads, providing solutions that simplifies client management. Whether you're new to the field or a seasoned pro, ConnectCare offers intuitive features that prioritize efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. 
Furthermore, ConnectCare boasts a range of benefits that directly address the needs of social workers, including: 

* **Increased Efficiency:** Spend less time on software and more time directly helping clients.
* **Reduced Errors:** Minimize errors caused by switching between input methods.
* **Boosted Productivity:** Complete tasks faster and free up valuable time for client interaction.

##### Embrace a Keyboard-Centric Approach

Social workers often spend significant time documenting and updating client information.  By minimizing the use of your mouse, ConnectCare allows for a smoother workflow, especially when working remotely or on laptops.

This approach can significantly reduce:

* Hand fatigue and strain.
* Cognitive load from switching between input methods.
* Overall time spent completing tasks.

##### Work Offline, Stay Productive

ConnectCare doesn't need constant internet. This means you can update client information even in areas with spotty reception. Perfect for home visits, field work, or anywhere life takes you.

##### Sensitive Data is kept Secure

ConnectCare takes data security seriously. Unlike some systems, ConnectCare stores your client information directly on your device, not on the internet. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, keeping your client information safe and secure.

##### Focus on Your Clients, Not Software

ConnectCare simplifies tasks, freeing up your time for what truly matters - building relationships with your clients. Respond faster, deliver better care, and make a real difference in their lives.

# CLI guide
Our application uses a [CLI](#cli) and primarily, running commands is how users interact with the application. 

## Structure
Each command has the general structure:
1. Main command
2. Parameters

To enter a command:
1. Click on the text box with the placeholder text `Enter command here...`
2. Type in your command, which is made up of a main command, followed by parameters if applicable. Here we have the command `add n/Derek Lau p/92784935 e/dlau@example.com` entered into the command box.

        <markdown> Figure 1.2: Application with command in textbox </markdown>
    </pic>
</div>

3. Press the `ENTER` key and voil√†! You have added your first client with the CLI!

        <markdown> Figure 1.3: Application after command is executed </markdown>
    </pic>
</div>

## Notes about the command format
-   In this guide, words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

-   Parameters in square brackets are optional.
    e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

-   Parameters with `‚Ä¶` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
    e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

-   Parameters can be in any order.
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

-   Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
    e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

**Tip:** If you have difficulty adding clients, check if you have the correct prefixes

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** If you want tags containing multiple words, consider using camel case (e.g. `t/fallRisk`).

**Tip:** You can use spaces in place of special characters in the names you want to enter (for the NAME or NEXT_OF_KIN parameters).

**Examples:**
-   `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`
-   `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend d/Takes anxiety medication k/Bethany Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Blk 684A Jurong West Central 1 #10-124 p/92748321 t/lowPriority`
-   `add n/Aaron James p/84362143 e/billj@example.com a/400 Balestier Road #02-27 Balestier Plaza t/highPriority k/John Doe d/Has low blood pressure`

**Walkthrough:**

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the `add` command. In this example, after using the [`list`](#listing-all-persons-list) command,
the full clients list is displayed. Thereafter, the `add` command was used, using the parameters `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 k/Joe Doe d/Has a history of memory loss t/mentalIllness t/owesMoney`.
After execution, the client `John Doe` is added successfully with the corresponding parameters!

What if the command was used with invalid parameters? In the example on the left, the command `add n/Matthew Kit` was used, which does not contain all the compulsory parameters.
Here the error message shown tells us that our command format is invalid and shows an example command, which lets you know the correct parameters to use for the command.
In the example on the right, the command `add n/Matthew Kit p/abc65432 e/matk@example.com a/123, Queenstown Ave 2, #03-25 k/Sofie Poe d/Short of hearing` is used, which again is invalid. Here the error message shown is `Phone numbers should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long` which lets you know specifically that the phone number given was invalid.
As the commands given were invalid, there would be no changes to the client list.

### Deleting a client: `delete`

_This command allows you to delete a client at a specified `INDEX` from your client list._

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

<markdown>

| Parameter | Description                            | Remarks                                                                                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INDEX     | Index of the client you want to delete | Index needs to be a number 1 or greater and cannot be more than the number of clients in your list |
</markdown>
</panel>

&nbsp;

**Examples:**
- `delete 1` would delete the first client in your client list.
- `delete 2` would delete the second client in your client list.

**Walkthrough**:

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the `delete` command. In this example, after using the `list` command,
the full clients list is displayed. Thereafter, the `delete 3` command was used, removing `John Doe`, the first person in the list, from the list of client contacts.

        <markdown> Figure 1.2: After the `delete 3` command is executed </markdown>
    </pic>
</div>

&nbsp;

What if the command was used with an incorrect index? In the example on the left, `delete 0` command was used, which is an invalid index.
Here the error message shown is `Invalid command format! ... Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer)` which lets you know to retype the command with a larger index value.
In the example on the right, `delete 4` is used, which again is invalid. Here the error message shown is `The person index provided is invalid` which lets you know to retype the command with a lower index.
As the commands given were invalid, there would be no changes to the client list.

Now that we are done with the **delete** command let's move on to the **update** command!

---

### Updating a client: `update`

_This command helps update existing client's information in the client list in the event that something changes._

**Format:** `update u/EXISTING_USER [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/DESCRIPTION] [k/NEXTOFKIN] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶`

<box type="info">

**Note:** At least one optional parameter has to be given.

**Example:**
-   `update u/Jane Doe n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-011` This command updates Jane Doe's information to be as follows: </br>
    - name: John Doe  
    - phone no: 98765432
    - email: [johnd@example.com](mailto:johnd@example.com)  
    - address: John street, block 123, #01-011

**Walkthrough:**

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the `update` command. In this example, after using the `list` command,
the full clients list is displayed. Thereafter, the `update` command was used, using the parameters `u/Peter Crow p/94325412 e/petercrow@example.com`.
After execution, the client `Peter Crow` is updated successfully with the corresponding parameters!

What if the command was used with invalid parameters? In the example on the left, the command `update u/Unknown Person p/92374832` was used, which specifies a name not in the name list.
Here the error message shown is `The person name provided is invalid` which lets you know that you are trying to update a client that does not exist.
In the example on the right, the command `update u/Peter Crow p/abc123` is used, which again is invalid. Here the error message shown is `Phone numbers should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long` which lets you know specifically that the phone number given was invalid.
As the commands given were invalid, there would be no changes to the client list.

Now that we are done with the **update** command let's move on to the **list** command!

### Listing all clients: `list`
_This command shows a list of all persons._

**Format:** `list`

**Examples:**

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the [`list`](#listing-all-persons-list) command. In this example, after using the [`find`](#locating-clients-by-name-find) command,
only `Peter Crow` was shown in the list. Thereafter, the `list` command was used, displaying the entire list of client contacts.

### Finding clients: `find`

_This command allows you to find clients in your client list by specifying client parameters that you are interested in._

**Format:** `find [n/NAME]‚Ä¶ [a/KEYWORD]‚Ä¶ [e/KEYWORD]‚Ä¶ [t/KEYWORD]‚Ä¶ [k/KEYWORD]‚Ä¶ [d/KEYWORD]‚Ä¶ [p/KEYWORD]‚Ä¶`

<box type="info">

**Note:** At least one optional parameter has to be given.

**Example:**
- `find p/99824412`
- `find n/xavier k/polly`
- `find n/bobby`

**Walkthrough:**

Let's say your client list contains the following clients:

        <markdown> Figure 1.1: _An example client list in ConnectCare (as indicated by the red box)_ </markdown>
    </pic>
</div>

-   `find n/alex` would return `Alex Yeoh` as the client name matches with `alex`.
-   `find n/alex p/99272758 ` would return `Alex Yeoh` as the client name matches with `alex`
    as well as `Bernice Yu` as the client phone number matches with `99272758`.
-   `find p/9` would return `Bernice Yu`, `Charlotte Oliveiro` and `David Li` as their phone numbers all
    start with `9`.

**Note:** you can search for multiple keywords, for example `find n/name1 n/name2` would search for all clients with names that contain name1 OR name2
This also applies to the optional keywords, for example `find n/name1 a/address1 a/address2 would search for all clients with names that contain name1 AND
have an address that contains address1 OR address2, for example:
-   `find n/alex n/bernice` would return `Alex Yeoh` as well as `Bernice Yu`
-   `find t/friends t/family` would return `Alex Yeoh`, `Bernice Yu`, and `David Li`
</box>

**Tip:**
After searching for clients, you can use the `list` command to view your full list of clients again!

Now that we are done with the **find** command let's move on to the **display** command!

### Displaying a client's information: `display`

_This command allows you to view a client's information in a more detailed manner_

**Format:** `display NAME`

<panel header="Parameter Descriptions and Remarks" alt="Parameters" minimized>
<markdown>

| Parameter | Description                                 | Remarks                                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| NAME      | Full name of the client you want to display | Name must be present in the client list  |
</markdown>
</panel>

&nbsp;

**Examples:**

`display Peter Crouch` would display all of Peter's information as a contact card on the application.

**Walkthrough:**

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the `display` command. In this example, after using the `list` command,
the full clients list is displayed. Thereafter, the `display Peter Crouch` command was used, displaying Peter. The cursor automatically moves
to the description box, allowing you to make changes to Peter's details. After making the necessary changes, hit enter. The details will be updated
and you will be redirected back to the home page with the clients list. At no stage do you need to reach for the mouse!

    </pic>
</div>

<box type="warning">

**Caution:**
While you are in the display view, you cannot enter any commands in the command box other than the [list command](#listing-all-persons-list) which will swap you back into the list view.
Any changes you make to description by reverting to the list view using this method would not be saved. Alternatively, you can the press ENTER key and the [undo command](#undoing-a-command-undo) to revert the changes.
If you would like to resume entering commands, press the ENTER key in the description box (which will save your changes) to return to the list view.

Now that we are done with the **Appointment management** features let's move on to the **Program controls**!

---

## Program Controls
ConnectCare provides the following commands for navigating the application:
* Undoing a command: `undo`
* Redoing a command: `redo`
* Shortcuts
* `up` arrow
* `down` arrow

Let's talk about the different **Program controls**, starting with the **undo** command

### Undoing a command : `undo`

_This command allows you to undo your last command, restoring the ConnectCare application to its previous state._

Format: `undo`

**Walkthrough:**

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the `undo` command.

In this example, after using the `add` command to add a new client `Charlie`, I wish to undo this addition as bertrand will not be assigned to me.
As seen in the second image, after using the `undo` command, Charlie is no longer present in the client list as his addition has been undone.
&nbsp;

<div class="image-container" align="middle" style="display:flex">
    <pic src="images/user-guide/undo_command_before1.png" alt="list">

        Figure 1.2: After the undo command is executed
    </pic>
</div>
&nbsp;

<box type="tip">

**Tip:**
The undo command does not undo every single command, only those that change the ConnectCare application in a significant way.
If you are at the earliest state (i.e. you can't undo any command) an appropriate error message will be displayed: "You cannot rollback the state anymore!"
For a comprehensive deep-dive into the undo command, please refer to the [Implementation section of our Developer Guide](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)

</box>

Now that we are done with the **undo** command let's move on to the **redo** command!

---

### Redoing a command : `redo`

_This command allows you to redo your command, reversing any changes that were previously undone._

Format: `redo`

**Walkthrough:**

The screenshots below are what you would expect when using the `redo` command.

In this example, after undoing an update of my client's name from `Peter Crow` to `Peter Crouch`, we can see that the current client list has his name as `Peter Crow`
As seen in the second image, after using the `redo` command, the change is redone, and the client list shows the client's name as `Peter Crouch`

        Figure 1.2: After the redo command is executed
    </pic>
</div>
&nbsp;

<box type="tip">

**Tip:**
The redo command does not redo every single command, only those that change the ConnectCare application in a significant way. 
If you are at the most recent state (i.e. you can't redo this command) an appropriate error message will be displayed: "You cannot roll forward the state anymore!"
For a comprehensive deep-dive into the redo command, please refer to the [Implementation section of our Developer Guide](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)

### Shortcuts
_These are a list of keyboard actions to better navigate our application_

<box type="tip">

**Tip:** These shortcuts only work when the text box is selected.
</box>


| Action | Description                                    |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Up`   | Displays the previous command entered, if any. |
| `Down` | Displays the next command entered, if any.     |

<box type="info">

**Note**: A message will be displayed in the dialog "Keyboard Shortcuts: There are no more commands to display!" to notify users when there are no previous/next command available.
</box>

<box type="info">

**Note**: Only commands that have been executed successfully will be saved.

Click [here](#table-of-contents) to return to the table of contents!

Let's now understand how data is saved and managed in the application.

---

## Saving the data

Your locally saved client list will be updated after any change is made, so no further action needs to be taken when operating the application! On start-up, your existing client list (if it exists) will also be automatically loaded, so don't worry about that!

<box type="info">

**Note**: If it is your first time running the program, and there is no existing client list, a new file will automatically be generated to store your new client list once changes are made!

# Glossary

##### CLI
CLI stands for Command Line Interface, which is a way for you to interact with the application with only textual
commands, there is no need for a mouse. Once you learn the commands, CLIs can be faster for repetitive tasks than navigating menus with a mouse.
For more information, see also the [Wikipedia article for CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

##### Local
Local applications runs on the same computer it is launched on and there is no program or data that is being ran or transferred to another remote machine.
For more information, see also this [Microsoft article for Local and Remote execution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/run-manage-packages-programmatically/understanding-the-differences-between-local-and-remote-execution?view=sql-server-ver16)
